# Smart-Waste-Segregation-System-using-Python-and-ML
Smart waste segregator which automates the segregation of bio-degradable and non-biodegradable waste and displays analytics report in dashboard.

Machine Learning has revolutionized the industry by enabling automation of the smallest as well as the most tedious jobs, with great unfathomable efficiency. One of the major
problem most companies and business hubs face is the excessive waste of manpower and resources for surveillance and monitoring. 

Worldwide interest in smart cities has aggrandized, fostered by the need to find effective remedies to the major challenges foreseen for the next
years. As one of the applications of smart city, waste management in a city is a formidable challenge faced by the public administrations. 

In order to overcome from this, we build humanoid robot to help them, particular this project deals with robotic arm to pick an object, place it in appropriate place so that waste can be segregated efficiently.
